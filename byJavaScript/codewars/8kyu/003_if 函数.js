Who likes keywords? Nobody likes keywords, so why use them?

You know what keyword I use too much? if! We should make a function called _if, with its arguments as
a logical test and two functions/lambdas where the first function is executed if the boolean is true,
and the second if it's false, like an if/else statement, so that we don't have to mess around with
those nasty keywords! Even so, It should support truthy/falsy types just like the keyword.


// TODO: Add your tests here
// Starting from Node 10.x, [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) is used instead of our custom test framework.
// [Codewars' assertion methods]
(https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Codewars-JavaScript-Test-Framework)
// are still available for now.
//
// For new tests, using [Chai](https://chaijs.com/) is recommended.
// You can use it by requiring:
//     const assert = require("chai").assert;
// If the failure output for deep equality is truncated, `chai.config.truncateThreshold` can be
adjusted.

describe("Solution", function() {
  it("should test for something", function() {
    // Test.assertEquals(1 + 1, 2);
    // assert.strictEqual(1 + 1, 2);
  });
});
